## Projects

**1. Do Rich People Sleep in Peace? Relationship Between Income And Sleep Quality (Grade: A+)**
- Programming language: R
- Programming environment: Jupyter notebook
- Packages: MASS, Stargazer

**Short Description**  
**Background:** Sleep is undoubtedly an inevitable part of our life. Despite an abundance of literature on sleep and its determinants and influencing factors, little has been explored on the independent association of sleep with income. The purpose of this study was twofold- i) to examine the relation of income with sleep quality and ii) the role of self-reported health status in explaining the socioeconomic differences in sleep.

**Methods:** Data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (2017-18) was used for the study including several sociodemographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and self-reported health variables. Exploratory data analysis and Ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to examine if the association between income and trouble sleeping was independent of other factors as well as whether health status mediates the socio-economic effects on sleep.

**Results:** Income was significantly associated with sleep quality both independently and after adjusting for all other variables. In unadjusted models, relatively higher income groups were less likely to have trouble sleeping than the lowest income group. However, in the adjusted model, the odds of trouble sleeping were higher and significant for the highest income group (OR=1.14; P< 0.01). Additionally, health status fully mediated the effect of income discrepancies in sleep but only for lower-income groups. 

**Conclusion:** Being socioeconomically disadvantaged might contribute to poor sleep quality, but higher income also does not protect against sleep problems. Lower-income groups are vulnerable to poor health status that can explain their sleep quality while further research is needed to address the sleep problems among the higher-income group.

**2. Effect of Service Quality and Price Fairness on Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty: Moderating Role of Gender and Occupation (Group Project; Grade: A+)**
- Statistical software: SPSS, AMOS, Plugin: Andrew Hayes Process Macro
- Statistical tests: Descriptive Statistics, Exploratory Factor Analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), Moderation analysis.

**Short Description**  
**Background:** Service quality and price fairness are deemed to be two important antecedents of customer satisfaction and customer loyalty which are two key strategic sources of sustainable performance for any company. The purpose of this study is twofold - to examine the effect of service quality and price fairness on customer loyalty through satisfaction and to understand the effect of two socio-demographic characteristics of customers on these relationships. 

**Methods:** Secondary data was collected from an open data repository that met the criteria to address the study objectives. Data consisted of 384 observations. After data screening and preparation, the validity and reliability of the constructs including five dimensions of service quality, price fairness, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty were assessed with Chronbach’s alpha and exploratory factor analysis. After that, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to confirm the attributes of each factor by assessing the convergent and discriminant validity of the constructs with average variance extracted values and composite reliability. Three of the hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling in AMOS and four were tested with Andrew Hayes process macro in SPSS. 

**Results:** The results showed that service quality and price fairness significantly influence customer satisfaction and customer satisfaction significantly affects customer loyalty. Additionally, it was found that gender and customers’ occupation moderates the relationship between price fairness and customer satisfaction.

**Implication:** This study is expected to add to the current literature on customer satisfaction and loyalty as well as help hospitality managers to understand the factors significantly influencing customer loyalty and undertake appropriate strategies to retain customers.

**3. Effect of Satisfaction with Human Resource Management Practices on Employee’s Intention to Stay (Grade: A+)**
- Statistical software: SPSS.
- Statistical tests: Descriptive statistics, Hierarchial Regression

**Short Description**  
**Background:** Growing concern over the increasing trend of employee turnover in organizations has attracted scholars to investigate and identify its significant predictors. This study examines whether employee perceptions of human resource management (HRM) practices influence their intention to stay with the organization. Based on the previous literature and established theories, I hypothesized that pay satisfaction, satisfaction with work involvement, and satisfaction with
learning opportunities within the organization positively predict the intention to stay. 

**Methods:** A cross-sectional survey data in the retail sector with 672 data points were used. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical regression analysis were conducted to test the hypotheses. 

**Results:** The results indicated that all three measures of HRM practices positively and significantly predicted the intention to stay. The study contributes to the understanding of the role of satisfaction with HRM practices on the employees’ withdrawal attitudes. 

**Implication:** Practical implication includes drawing employers’ attention to improving their HRM policies and practices to meet the expectation of the employees in order to influence their turnover attitudes.

**4. A Cross-sectional Survey on the Attitudes Towards Telemedicine During COVID-19 and Intention to Use after the Pandemic.**
- Statistical softwares: For survey design: Microsoft Forms; For data analysis: SPSS, NVivo 12
- Statistical tests: _Quantitative_: Descriptive statistics; _Qualitative_: Narrative analysis 

**Short Description**  
**Background:** There have been several studies in the past that investigated the patterns of telemedicine use, patient satisfaction among specific populations using specific telehealth services provided by the hospitals, organizations, or other practice settings. Since the beginning of the pandemic, few studies have been conducted to determine the trend of virtual care and patients’ satisfaction who have used specific telemedicine services. However, how this change in consultation method being mostly remote and virtual, is affecting people’s treatment-seeking behavior and whether the effect is going to last longer even after the pandemic ends as is predicted by some, these questions are yet to be explored. Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate the attitudes of people regarding telemedicine use and whether it affects the intention to use telemedicine after the pandemic through a cross-sectional survey.

**Methods:** This is a descriptive cross-sectional study aiming at understanding peoples’ attitudes toward telemedicine use and their intention to use this remote mode of healthcare in the future. For this study, a survey instrument was developed with 12 questions including demographic information, attitude to telemedicine, frequency of using telemedicine services, and satisfaction level (if used), and intention for future use along with two open-ended questions. Data were analyzed using SPSS and NVivo (for responses from open-ended questions).

**Results:** Around 85.7% said that they used telemedicine service at least once during this pandemic. Among the platforms used for receiving telemedicine care, the most common was the telephone (57.14%) followed by video conferencing through Zoom or Google Meet). More than 70% of respondents agreed that telemedicine saves time, reduces travel time, convenient, feels comfortable discussing their problems during teleconsultation, and not very concerned about privacy breaches. However, 50% of the respondents were not confident about the quality of the treatment through telemedicine. Nearly 90% of those who used telemedicine indicated at least some degree of satisfaction  and those who had positive attitudes also expressed their intention to use telemedicine in the future.

**Conclusion:** This study has been able to provide an important insight into the current use trend of telemedicine, its perceived usefulness, people’s attitudes and perceptions of telecommunication with their healthcare providers, the likeliness of teleconsultation being durable and preferable in future, and factors that could affect that possibility. With the constant advancement of technology in healthcare more and more studies should focus on the remote mode of healthcare deliveries as pandemic like COVID-19 might not be the last one and identifying the factors preventing or facilitating the use of remote consultation by studying the people’s attitudes and perceptions might provide the scope to develop right interventions at right time. 

**5. Perceptions of Academic Researchers About Publishing Pressure: A Thematic Analysis**
- Statistical software: NVivo 12
- Statiscical method: Thematic analysis on semi-stuctured interviews 

**Short Description**  
**Background:** In recent years, the number of scientific articles and papers publishing in different journals has changed dramatically along with the change in the trend of journal publishing culture. Researchers sometimes experience the pressure of publishing which can be attributed to several factors including the competition among scientists to publish in the higher ranking journals, career progression in their field of study. The purpose of this study is to understand the perceptions of the researchers on the publishing pressure through their own experiences. Our main focus is academic researchers from different fields who are affiliated with different universities in the United Kingdom. This study is intended to add to the current knowledge of researchers’ publishing attitudes and behavior by exploring the similarities and differences between the perceived thoughts of researchers on publishing pressure.

**Methods:** Qualitative semi-structured interviews of academic researchers were collected from “Figshare”, which is an open-access data repository. The interviewees ranged from Ph.D. students to senior professors in their career position. The interviews started with the narration of the respondents on their decision of choosing "scientist or researcher" as a profession, which then focused on their academic career and publishing practices, their perception of publishing pressure, and finally ended with their thoughts on Open Access publishing. Data were analyzed with an inductive content analysis approach in NVivo-12. 

**Results:** Seven themes were identified and the inter-rater reliability coefficient was satisfactory for all the themes (Cohen’s Kappa > 0.7). All the themes were common and vividly presented in the narration of the three participants as they recounted their academic and professional careers and perceived the change in publication trend and culture along with the publishing pressure either from their own experience or through others surrounding them. The themes are (in the order of most frequent occurrences)- Funding, Competition, Impact Factor, Career Progression, Recognition, Personality, Institutional Factor.

**Conclusion:** The study has contributed to the current knowledge on researchers’ perceptions about the publishing pressure by highlighting the current trend, identifying the influencing factors, and demonstrating the role of institutions in the publishing practice of the researchers. Further research on this matter might help the academics and institutions to develop interventions or make policy changes to protect the researchers from undue and unhealthy publishing pressure.
