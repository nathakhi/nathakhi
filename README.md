## About me

I am a highly motivated and experienced healthcare professional with a demonstrated history of working in the health care sector for more than five years. Having practiced as a physician for a long time, I developed a strong interest to engage myself in healthcare research and health management. I am well-versed in research methodologies. I have experience in conducting extensive literature review, and writing highly academic and professional reports. I am skilled at implementing several data analysis techniques and performing statistical modeling and tests on data from different sectors, especially health data using various softwares such as SPSS, AMOS. My growing interest in the use of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare has led me to learn and ace multiple programming languages (R, Python). I have strong problem solving, critical thinking, and analytical skills. I am experienced in working in a fast-paced environment; managing multiple tasks within a limited time frame, and collaborating within a team environment. I am able to communicate in four different languages (English, French, Bengali, Hindi). I am a fast learner who is very passionate to learn new subjects, face new challenges, and adopt new ideas. 

### Projects

**1. Do Rich People Sleep in Peace? Relationship Between Income And Sleep Quality (Grade: A+)**
- Programming language: R
- Programming environment: Jupyter notebook
- Packages: MASS, Stargazer

**Short Description**  
**Background:** Sleep is undoubtedly an inevitable part of our life. Despite an abundance of literature on sleep and its determinants and influencing factors, little has been explored on the independent association of sleep with income. The purpose of this study was twofold- i) to examine the relation of income with sleep quality and ii) the role of self-reported health status in explaining the socioeconomic differences in sleep.

**Methods:** Data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (2017-18) was used for the study including several sociodemographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and self-reported health variables. Exploratory data analysis and Ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to examine if the association between income and trouble sleeping was independent of other factors as well as whether health status mediates the socio-economic effects on sleep.

**Results:** Income was significantly associated with sleep quality both independently and after adjusting for all other variables. In unadjusted models, relatively higher income groups were less likely to have trouble sleeping than the lowest income group. However, in the adjusted model, the odds of trouble sleeping were higher and significant for the highest income group (OR=1.14; P< 0.01). Additionally, health status fully mediated the effect of income discrepancies in sleep but only for lower-income groups. 

**Conclusion:** Being socioeconomically disadvantaged might contribute to poor sleep quality, but higher income also does not protect against sleep problems. Lower-income groups are vulnerable to poor health status that can explain their sleep quality while further research is needed to address the sleep problems among the higher-income group.

**2. Effect of Service Quality and Price Fairness on Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty: Moderating Role of Gender and Occupation (Group Project; Grade: A+)**
- Statistical software: SPSS, AMOS, Plugin: Andrew Hayes Process Macro
- Statistical tests: Descriptive Statistics, Exploratory Factor Analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), Moderation analysis.

**Short Description**  
**Background:** Service quality and price fairness are deemed to be two important antecedents of customer satisfaction and customer loyalty which are two key strategic sources of sustainable performance for any company. The purpose of this study is twofold - to examine the effect of service quality and price fairness on customer loyalty through satisfaction and to understand the effect of two socio-demographic characteristics of customers on these relationships. 

**Methods:** Secondary data was collected from an open data repository that met the criteria to address the study objectives. Data consisted of 384 observations. After data screening and preparation, the validity and reliability of the constructs including five dimensions of service quality, price fairness, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty were assessed with Chronbach’s alpha and exploratory factor analysis. After that, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to confirm the attributes of each factor by assessing the convergent and discriminant validity of the constructs with average variance extracted values and composite reliability. Three of the hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling in AMOS and four were tested with Andrew Hayes process macro in SPSS. 

**Results:** The results showed that service quality and price fairness significantly influence customer satisfaction and customer satisfaction significantly affects customer loyalty. Additionally, it was found that gender and customers’ occupation moderates the relationship between price fairness and customer satisfaction.

**Implication:** This study is expected to add to the current literature on customer satisfaction and loyalty as well as help hospitality managers to understand the factors significantly influencing customer loyalty and undertake appropriate strategies to retain customers.

**3. Effect of Satisfaction with Human Resource Management Practices on Employee’s Intention to Stay (Grade: A+)**
- Statistical software: SPSS.
- Statistical tests: Descriptive statistics, Hierarchial Regression

**Short Description**  
**Background:** Growing concern over the increasing trend of employee turnover in organizations has attracted scholars to investigate and identify its significant predictors. This study examines whether employee perceptions of human resource management (HRM) practices influence their intention to stay with the organization. Based on the previous literature and established theories, I hypothesized that pay satisfaction, satisfaction with work involvement, and satisfaction with
learning opportunities within the organization positively predict the intention to stay. 

**Methods:** A cross-sectional survey data in the retail sector with 672 data points were used. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical regression analysis were conducted to test the hypotheses. 

**Results:** The results indicated that all three measures of HRM practices positively and significantly predicted the intention to stay. The study contributes to the understanding of the role of satisfaction with HRM practices on the employees’ withdrawal attitudes. 

**Implication:** Practical implication includes drawing employers’ attention to improving their HRM policies and practices to meet the expectation of the employees in order to influence their turnover attitudes.
